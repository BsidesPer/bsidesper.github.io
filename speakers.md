## Fergal Conner & Gordon Erasmos
Fergal & Gordon are recognised thought leaders and pivotal members of the information security community. Since their debut talk at WAHCKon[0] they have engaged with the community to inform, guide, and foster development of capability within the spheres cyber security. They claim joint credit for all advancement within the field since its inception.

### Synergising The Internet of Everything And Fog Computing To Actualise The Cyber Perl Harbor: A Cross-silo Byod Approach to Dynamically Mitigating Next-Generation Watering Holes
The synergistically entanglement of cloud, the internet of everything and big data (CIOEBD) has proven to be a silver bullet solution to the problem of escalating infrastructure needs and right-sizing. Although the lining of this cloud isn't always silver and additional revolutionary approaches are required to actualise the cyber pearl harbour. Specifically cross-silo approaches are necessitated between these disruptive technologies to reap real world benefits in the area of next-generation watering hole mitigation.

In this presentation Mr. Conner and Mr. Erasmos will discuss a staged implementation of these technologies in a no nonsense manner, with real world examples, focusing on:
- Solution based enterprise security deployments
- Multi vector threat detection logic to leverage intelligence capital
- Countering the mission oriented adversary in the digital area of operation
- Sustainable information waste management technologies

Partner at @elttam.

### A historical analysis of the security maturity of OpenSSH
In this presentation, Matt will look at the security history of OpenSSH - software that has had high security requirements and exposure due to it being an integral part of computer systems worldwide for the past 17 years.

A detailed analysis of previous security vulnerabilities will be performed, looking at the trends in vulnerability research and the eras of vulnerability classes over the years.  Further to this, a review for how OpenSSH has steadily matured its security and incorporated defensive measures to combat attacks and make itself resilient to threats will be presented.   

A portion of the talk will look at the core concepts to generalise the key offensive and defensive principles to everything we see today.  In particular, as platform, framework, and application security is constantly evolving, what are the core concepts and approaches for us to understand well and share with others to help evolve application security collectively?
