              <p>Duncan is a Director within PwC Australia's Cyber Security and Forensics practice. He has over 18 years experience in Offensive and Defensive Cyber Security roles and is the lead for the National Operational Technology Cyber Security capability and Perth Cyber Security team. He has worked in United Kingdom, Indonesia, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Australia.</p>
              <h3>Hacking the Grid</h3>
              <p>Critical Infrastructure and Operation Technology (OT) have finally been getting the coverage and attention that they require when it comes to Cyber Security. Operational Technology has only recently been networked and now with the emergence of IOT or Industrial IOT these systems that were deployed over 10 years ago now have new threats that were never designed for. Many organisations are saying they are secure due to network segregation and even air gapped networks between corporate and operational networks but in the same breath talk about IT/OT convergence. So what is the real truth? During this talk Duncan will explain how his team have been hacking into Electrical grids, Oil Platforms and other Industrial sites over the last seven years and ways to make it a little harder for the adversary.Â </p>

                  <p>Josh is a Principal Consultant in Mechanical Rock and has 10 years experience across a range of operations and development roles. Known as the giant one in Mechanical Rock with glorious hair, he regularly speaks around Perth on topics ranging from getting the most of our your local development environment to delivering deep presentations on core technical problems and solutions.</p>
                  <p>Having worked at companies during security incidents, and being charged with security remediation and building security in from the start in multiple scenarios, he is always looking to how to make security both understood and part of the team culture.</p>
                  <h3>Internal Red Teams - Practicing what you preach</h3>
                  <p>Being brought in as cloud native experts into organisations both big and small means that we need to be both current and succinct with our security guidance. As companies move into the cloud, it presents a different set of challenges, with different threat models relative to on premise installations. We believe the best way to distribute understanding and revise our processes is by stress testing them under realistic scenarios. This talk is the story of how we organised a surprise red team event orchestrated by a small group within the company to test not only our processes but also our people under fire.</p>

                  <p>Andrew spent 15 years writing software products, mostly in the systems, application and network monitoring spaces. After being involved in the application security uplift as a developer in his previous role, he moved on to be a founding member of Telstra's Secure Code team, and is currently trying to help secure all the code they produce.</p>
                  <h3>Validate your inputs! Is this really the message we want to send to developers?</h3>
                  <p>Often one of the key bits of advice security professionals give is around input validation. We need to white list the correct data to prevent abuse cases. But is this really the right way we want to get developers to approach the problem. I am going to look at what I think the current methods for doing this are and a how that might not be the best way of doing things. And perhaps there is a better message we can send.</p>

                  <p>Tristan has been in the security field for over a decade now and during this time has worked with organizations large and small. Logs files and Python now consume more hours of the week than is healthy but at least everyday is different.</p>
                  <h3>How Testing A Monitoring Rule Led to A Microsoft Bounty</h3>
                  <p>Testing SIEM rules is essential to their success as so many things can go wrong from log source to correlation. The best correlation rule is useless if the data being fed into it isn't what is expected. This talk will following through testing a number of easily deployed attacker tools and provide some tips on some of the things that can go wrong along the way. Logging that will be included is Windows Security, PowerShell, Sysmon.</p>

                  <h3>Coccinelle for Bug Discovery in C Source Code</h3>
                  <p>In this talk, I use a tool called coccinelle to discover bugs in C source code. Coccinelle uses a Semantic Patch Language and takes code templates to identify and, if desired, make patches to the relevant source code. The Linux kernel team use coccinelle to prevent bug patterns in git commits. I've written over 50 templates that describe the majority of bugs listed in the SEI CERT C Coding Standard. From this, I've scanned 500 random packages in Ubuntu and found numerous bugs. I've also looked at every package in the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS repository and pulled out every SUID binary and its associated source. I automated this approach and have regular and frequent scans of these packages to identify accidental introduction of bugs. Finally, I've used the NSA released reversing tool Ghidra to decompile binaries in headless mode. I've dumped firmware from embedded devices uses the BUSSide, extracted filesystem images with binwalk, decompiled relevant non x86 system binaries, and passed the source code to my Coccinelle scripts. Overall, coccinelle is tool that makes writing custom and generic static analysis tools for source code practical for many people.

                  <h3>Cyber Threat Intelligence - It's not just about the feeds.</h3>
                  <p>Although the practice of collecting and using intelligence has been studied and conducted by governments and the military for centuries, itâs relative application to Cyber Security has only recently been highlighted. This area of infosec has been termed Cyber Threat Intelligence, where the marriage of traditional intelligence techniques and analysis with deep technical understanding within the Cyber domain are used to predict future actions by threats through long term analysis and modelling. This approach is then used to support both proactive and reactive cyber security actions, from incident response to penetration testing. This presentation focuses on threat intelligence from a practical data perspective, moving away from just the commercial concept of threat intelligence feeds (although these form one part of the equation). This presentation will approach threat intelligence from an analysts perspective of what questions needs to be answered to effectively investigate an incident, using the Diamond Model and Cyber Kill Chain as framing devices. These questions will then lead to examples of the data that can be used to answer these questions. Although traditionally data collection has focused on external cyber information, more often than not however, itâs actions outside of those seen within an organisations network, or even outside cyberspace that can provide context to the actions a threat takes. Finally, we provide a number of use cases on which the results of threat intelligence processes can be applied within a Security Operations Centre, including Incident Response as well as traditional Penetration Testing and Red Teaming.

                <p>PHPSESSIONID, rack.session, play_session, JSESSIONID.... do these terms seem familiar ? In most languages and framework, the internals of session management are completely hidden from developers. In this talk, we are going to cover how sessions work across different languages and frameworks as well as what advantages and disadvantages implementations bring. We will also look at vulnerabilities impacting sessions in the recent years.

                  <h3>Understanding the Chromium Sandbox on Windows</h3>
                  <p>This talk will look at the Chromium sandbox, an important piece of technology that is being used by the worlds most popular web browsers to help protect systems from full system compromise. The area of browser sandboxing is relevant to everyone, and will very likely continue to be for sometime. <br /> <br /> The goal of the talk is to provide a good overview of what the Chromium sandbox is, how it works on Windows, how it's gone so far, and where this space may be going. The talk will include:<br /> - An introduction on the history, architecture, and design of the Chromium sandbox <br /> - A walk-through and a bunch of demos to understand the evolution of browser sandboxing on Windows - the types of offensive research and exploits that we've seen, how countermeasures have been developed, and how Windows 10 has been evolving till now to support the Chromium sandbox.<br /> - Closing with a look at the future for browser sandboxing on Windows

                  <h3>Unknown Security Wounds in Local Market</h3>
                  <p>Application security for organisations within Australia have been forgotten and more focus is put on infrastructure, network and device security. We have seen so many database breaches of Personal Identification Data, almost everyday we hear a database breach in news. This shows that organisations are not putting more focus on secure application design, configuration and application.<br /> The talk will run through few critical application vulnerabilities/security mis-configurations of web applications I discovered while doing security research, that exposed critical customer and user databases. The talk will share some experiences of working with the team to solve the issues, constrains and challenges we face to solve such security vulnerabilities.

                  <h3>C.I. can make $$$ from thin air</h3>
                  <p>We have all used free tools, easily available on the internet, however these tools are often open to misuse due to the lack of visibility and planning performed by the project team. This talk covers how people can utilise such resources, outside of their intended use case, in a malicious way. Using TravisCI as an example, we will look into what essentially can become a distributed super computer, to mine bitcoins, perform distributed password cracking, and distributed denial of service attacks, free of any cost whatsoever. This attack will be displayed in a demo. We then introduce core threat modelling concepts, which allow us to look into how such edge cases can be identified and how they can be remediated prior to publicly releasing such software.

                  <h3>Is there anyone on board who can fly a DevSecOps plane?!</h3>
                  <p>We are three years into our Enterprise Secure Code program, and last year we embarked on DevSecOps at scale. We are one of Australia's largest Telcos, and we are fundamentally transforming the way our company releases code into production.<br /> <br /> We have a huge and exciting goal of securing every line of code (*that we own and have written) without slowing down our development teams. In this talk I will describe the evolution of the Secure Code team and then walk through examples of how our initiatives are succeeding in helping projects to go live with fewer vulnerabilities and fewer interactions with Cyber Security.<br /> <br /> Born out of the Secure Code team, we also have a DevOps Security team with an equally exciting goal of delivering Security at Speed. In this session I will also share how DevSecOps has evolved for us, who were our stakeholders, how we built and established critical relationships, and look at where we have landed with DevSecOps today, before diving into one of our key initiatives - our Security Champion Program.<br /> <br /> Touching on the people, process, and technology aspects of creating an Application Security Capability that supports DevSecOps, I hope to leave you with an understanding of the approach we took, and key examples of what is working really well so that your Monday morning will be full of ideas about who to persuade and convince in your own organisation. <br />

                  <p>Raymond Schippers is the lead incident response analyst for Check Point in the APAC region. He has over a decade of IT security experience and is loves tracking down bad guys and working with organisations on how they can enhance their defenses to deal with threats.</p>
                  <h3>Attackers in the Castle: Responding to persistent attackers inside your systems.</h3>
                  <p>Based on lessons learnt from our investigations into targeted attacks, by both cyber criminals and state sponsored attackers, defenders will be provided advice on how to better defend their castles, common mistakes made when building new castles, and better ways of responding to these incidents quickly and effectively. This includes easy changes that can be made to Active Directory to harden it, using open source intelligence to look for common attack patterns, ensuring business continuity plans are in place and work, and ensuring defenders don't make common configurations we have seen in the cloud. The talk will also discuss if an attacker did compromise the system, how can you detect it, and what steps you need to take to start cleaning up post invasion.

                  <p>Michael (also known as codingo) is heavily active in the open source space as https://github.com/codingo. Michael has written and maintains a number of tools, focused on web application security including but not limited to Reconnoitre, NoSQLMap, VHostScan, and Interlace. Michael also helps to maintain a number of online resources of interest to defensive teams including tools and datasets for the mitigation of ransomware, crypto jacking, key verification, and fingerprinting of services that are vulnerable to subdomain takeovers.</p>
                  <p>Michael spoke at BSides Canberra in 2018 on SharePoint Security presenting new research in the space as well as a variety of PowerShell scripts to aid in SharePoint security assessments. Michael also presented an overview on subdomain takeovers at BSides Perth in September of 2018 with an emphasis on detection for organisations that have a reliance on cloud-based services. In September of 2019, Michael will be presenting on complex attack chains at BSides Perth.</p>
                  <p>In 2019 Michael won Bugcrowd's community champion award and has also been nominated for both the AISA Cyber Security Professional of the Year and the AISA Rising Star awards, to be decided in late 2019. In 2019 Michael has also teamed up with Jason Haddix to author the Bug Hunters Methodology, which is expected to be released late 2020.</p>
                  <h3>Bug Chaining - and why to address low risk issues</h3>
                  <p>Not all bug classes are built identically, and not all are interesting or necessarily even fun to exploit. Additionally, exploitation of minor bug classes is often halted prematurely with far too many XSS exploitations being performed with an âalert(1)â when so many more interesting things can be done.<br /> <br /> This talk is a visual demonstration of the importance of defence in depth. It aims to cover two interesting attack chains where a number of low priority issues were combined in interesting ways to cause the equivalent outcome of more severe bug classes in software. The intention of this talk, and demonstration is to highlight the importance of properly closing low priority issues, and not only resolving higher risk ones.
