## Synergising The Internet of Everything And Fog Computing To Actualise The Cyber Perl Harbor: A Cross-silo Byod Approach to Dynamically Mitigating Next-Generation Watering Holes
### [By Fergal Conner & Gordon Erasmos](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#fergal-conner--gordon-erasmos)
The synergistically entanglement of cloud, the internet of everything and big data (CIOEBD) has proven to be a silver bullet solution to the problem of escalating infrastructure needs and right-sizing. Although the lining of this cloud isn't always silver and additional revolutionary approaches are required to actualise the cyber pearl harbour. Specifically cross-silo approaches are necessitated between these disruptive technologies to reap real world benefits in the area of next-generation watering hole mitigation.

In this presentation Mr. Conner and Mr. Erasmos will discuss a staged implementation of these technologies in a no nonsense manner, with real world examples, focusing on:
- Solution based enterprise security deployments
- Multi vector threat detection logic to leverage intelligence capital
- Countering the mission oriented adversary in the digital area of operation
- Sustainable information waste management technologies

## A historical analysis of the security maturity of OpenSSH
### [By Matt Jones](bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#matt-jones)
In this presentation, Matt will look at the security history of OpenSSH - software that has had high security requirements and exposure due to it being an integral part of computer systems worldwide for the past 17 years.

A detailed analysis of previous security vulnerabilities will be performed, looking at the trends in vulnerability research and the eras of vulnerability classes over the years.  Further to this, a review for how OpenSSH has steadily matured its security and incorporated defensive measures to combat attacks and make itself resilient to threats will be presented.   

A portion of the talk will look at the core concepts to generalise the key offensive and defensive principles to everything we see today.  In particular, as platform, framework, and application security is constantly evolving, what are the core concepts and approaches for us to understand well and share with others to help evolve application security collectively?

## Bypass Techniques, because I am lazy
[### By Adam Foster aka Evildaemond](bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#Adam-Foster-aka-Evildaemond)
About 2 years ago, Adam made the discovery of lockpicking, about 2 days after that he purchased his first bypass tool, because why use the slower, less effective method when you can use the quick and efficient method? (Hint: Adam will explain why). In this talk, Adam will cover some of the basics of physical bypass techniques, how you can use this for fun and profit (and when your mates lose the door handle to the flywire door out the back), and some cool tricks and tools he has picked up along the way.
